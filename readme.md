# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Rep
## Joseph Larson
Through this class, I hope to gain a basic understanding of coding and website design.  My hope is that I can use this knowledge in the future as I move into a professional work environment, whether it be for my own business ventures or working for someone else.
- I was interested to learn that the internet was a result of the arpanet, a defense program
- The invention of a non-linear method of transferring information, ie the web
- The actual tangible element of the internet (the cables connecting continents) was very interesting
